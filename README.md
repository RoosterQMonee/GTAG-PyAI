# ~~Gorilla Tag AI~~ Virtual Reality AI

### General data

#### Removed

* Neural Networks ( bad, slow, pretty much useless )
* Original programming language ( same as Neural Networks )
* Engine ( also the same )
* Sound / Text presets ( there seems to be a pattern appearing )
* VR / XR ( Entire rewrite )

### Update

New pc lesgo

i might be able to continue working on this since i can actually run gtag on pc

also i was SERIOUSLY overcomplicating this

idk how it took me a whole year to realize that

also no more devlog, too complex

### PyAI

#### For people that want to help:

what i am struggling with is making controller instances, along with a headset. my goal is to create these without actual hardware, and be able to control them from within this as an app and its programming language.

this was made so there is no hardware needed other than the device with this project on it

Update:

if you have any idea how to make controllable vr devices, please let me know, ive been struggling for almost a year now

About

This is an actual Gorilla Tag AI, unlike the other 9-year-olds that go into lobbies playing "Creepy" music while pretending to be this super scary hacker AI named "PBBV" or "Echo", this isn't going to be like the other "AI's". He's just going to walk around and use voice commands

Why
---
I'm making this because it gets really annoying whenever people go into lobbies and start playing "Creepy" music while pretending to be this oh so scary hacker AI, like stated above; also I can actually make the first of something

What this does
---
Idk yet.

I have some awesome people helping me come up with some ideas though :)

Development
---
I'm gonna put some fancy analytics stuff here whenever I can gather data

:D
