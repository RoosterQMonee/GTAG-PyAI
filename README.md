# Gorilla Tag AI


### PyAI

please help me

im losing my sanity

About
---

This is an actual Gorilla Tag AI, unlike the other 9-year-olds that go into lobbies playing "Creepy" music while pretending to be this super scary hacker AI named "PBBV" or "Echo"

Why
---
I'm making this because it gets really annoying whenever people go into lobbies and start playing "Creepy" music while pretending to be this oh so scary hacker AI, like stated above; also I can actually make the first of something

What this does
---
Idk yet.

I have some awesome people helping me come up with some ideas though :)

Development
---
I'm gonna put some fancy analytics stuff here whenever I can gather data

:D
