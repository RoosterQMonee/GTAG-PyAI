# Gorilla Tag AI


### PyAI

please help me

im losing my sanity

Update:

if you have any idea how to make controllable vr devices, please let me know, ive been struggling for 2 months now

About
---

This is an actual Gorilla Tag AI, unlike the other 9-year-olds that go into lobbies playing "Creepy" music while pretending to be this super scary hacker AI named "PBBV" or "Echo", this isn't going to be like the other "AI's". He's just going to walk around and use voice commands

Why
---
I'm making this because it gets really annoying whenever people go into lobbies and start playing "Creepy" music while pretending to be this oh so scary hacker AI, like stated above; also I can actually make the first of something

What this does
---
Idk yet.

I have some awesome people helping me come up with some ideas though :)

Development
---
I'm gonna put some fancy analytics stuff here whenever I can gather data

:D
